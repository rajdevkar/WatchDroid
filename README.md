# WATCHDROID

WatchDroid application is based on keylogger i.e. a type of surveillance software (considered to be either software or spyware) which has the capability to record every keystroke you make to a log file.
WatchDroid is specially developed for parents for spying on their kids. It can be also used for checking unnecessary actions on their mobile. WatchDroid can record instant messages and any information you type at any time using your keyboard. It also captures document content, passwords, user ID’s, and other potentially sensitive bits of information. 
WatchDroid also has an additional feature, which is an advanced pin protection mechanism than the traditional pin method with a small change. The user has to set 2 index positions and in those positions, he has to enter two numbers which will be set as password numbers for the application. When the user tries to open the app he will be asked to enter a password. When the user enters the correct number in correct position then and then only app will be unlocked.
